# Code-for-Generating-Confusion-Matrix-ROC

When working with machine learning models, you may already have the key evaluation metrics — True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) — but face issues such as:
- Low-quality or unreadable confusion matrix plots
- Difficulty copying or reusing the generated figures
- Missing or poorly formatted ROC curve visualizations

This project provides a simple yet effective way to recreate high-quality confusion matrices and ROC curves directly from these fundamental values.

The current version focuses on clarity and usability, ensuring visually appealing and publication-ready outputs. Further improvements will focus on making the tool more robust, dynamic, and adaptable to different datasets and evaluation scenarios.
